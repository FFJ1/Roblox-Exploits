## Installing plugins on IY

1. Download the plugin you want to use.
2. Copy it to your exploit's workspace folder, making sure the file has `.iy` extension.
3. Execute Infinite Yield in your game and go to it's Settings > Manage Plugins > Add > Enter the file name, for example if you downloaded a file `yourfile.iy`, you have to enter `yourfile` without the `.iy` extension.
4. It might not show up as added if it's a plugin for a specific game, make sure you're in the right game if it's made for specific game.
5. That's all! The commands will get added to infinite yield and you can use the infinite yeild command bar to use the plugin!

- Update :-
   1. Added more items to ESP from Super Hard Mode.
   2. Decreased the Text Size of ESP.
   3. Added `quickapply | {qa}` to quickly loop speed to 20, full bright, enable event notifier and esp.
   4. Fixed some known bugs.
   5. Btw, using `autoloot` may be a wrong idea in Super Hard Mode as Greed will be able to easily get you.

- Last Update :- 2nd April 2023
