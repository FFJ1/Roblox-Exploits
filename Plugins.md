## Installing plugins on IY

1. Download the plugin you want to use.
2. Copy it to your exploit's workspace folder, making sure the file has `.iy` extension.
3. Execute Infinite Yield in your game and go to it's Settings > Manage Plugins > Add > Enter the file name, for example if you downloaded a file `yourfile.iy`, you have to enter `yourfile` without the `.iy` extension.
4. It might not show up as added if it's a plugin for a specific game, make sure you're in the right game if it's made for specific game.
5. That's all! The commands will get added to infinite yield and you can use the infinite yeild command bar to use the plugin!

- The `[]` means that is a placeholder and you need to replace it
without the `[]`.
- The `<>` also means it's a placeholder but it's optional and can be left empty.

- Default Time: `10`
- Time values are not exact and may vary depending on the ping.
- Decimal time values also matter so try increasing by `0.5` or `1` when it's
reacting too late or decreasing when it's reacting too early.
