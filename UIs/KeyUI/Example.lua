Supported Key formats:
1. Normal String: A normal string with your key.
2. Bcrypted String: This is your key in encrypted format. Using this ensures that your key cannot be viewed but can only be matched with a key if it's correct or not. It adds extra security. You can generate your encrypted key with any round between 4 and 10 at https://bcrypt-generator.com
3. Raw URL: A raw url of any website that just displays the key either in Normal String or Bcrypted String as a raw text.


Template for Whitelisted Raw Link:
{
   "Whitelisted":[
      123456789,
      123456789,
      123456789
   ]
}
