---------KEY SETTINGS---------

Supported Key types: (Required)
1. plain: A normal plain string with your key.
2. url: A raw url of any website that displays the key.

Supported Encryption types: (Optional)
1. bcrypt: This is your key in encrypted format. Using this ensures that your key cannot be viewed but can only be matched with a key if it's correct or not. It adds extra security. You can generate your encrypted key WITH ONLY 14 cost/rounds at https://bcrypt-generator.com/ for it to work.
